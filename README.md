# Formal Languages and Automata Theory
This repository contains projects that were made in the LFA laboratories at FMI UNIBUC 2025, such as DFA, NFA and regular expressions, which were written in Python.

### DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton)
A Python implementation of a **Deterministic Finite Automaton**.  
It reads a formal DFA description and checks whether a given input string is accepted, simulating state transitions and acceptance logic.

---

### NFA (Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton)
A simulation of a **Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton** that allows multiple possible transitions for a single input symbol.  
The program verifies acceptance by exploring all nondeterministic computation paths.

---

### PDA (Pushdown Automaton)
Implements a **Pushdown Automaton**, extending finite automata with a stack structure.  
It recognizes **context-free languages** such as balanced parentheses and nested expressions.

---

### Matrix Representation
A helper component using **matrix-based representations** of automata or transition relations.  
It can be used for analyzing or visualizing state transitions in a compact mathematical form.

---

### Turing Machine
A Python simulation of a **Turing Machine**, modeling tape movement, head operations, and the transition function.  
This project explores the concept of **computability** and how Turing Machines can simulate any algorithm.

---

## Summary
These mini-projects provide practical insight into key **automata theory concepts**, including finite automata, stack machines, and Turing-complete computation â€” all implemented in Python for educational purposes.
